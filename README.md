# Abstract:
Machine learning and an upsurge of advanced tools for data analysis has aided setting up different businesses a lot simpler and informed than ever before. Variety of insights about the demographics, culture, lifestyle, consumer demands, and ratings have enabled us to make informed decisions before implementing a business idea. In this project I analyse one such immediate and important feature of urban life: food and the entities that bring it to us. In this context I use a variety of data mining techniques to mine useful information from the data of a prominent restaurant aggregator and online delivery chain to predict the likelihood of success for a new restaurant based in Bengaluru region, Karnataka, India.
